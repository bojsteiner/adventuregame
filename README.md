Doing some self study through App Academy Open. This was a project where a starter was provided and we built upon it, the starter can be found here https://github.com/appacademy-starters/adventure-combat-starter.

In this game, a player can navigate through different rooms, pick them up, use them, and ultimately try to find the treasure. The player also encounters enemies that they can attack and get items from!
